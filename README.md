# Kit-Bitz

## An inventory management website for electronics hobbists to track inventory and share kits.

### Inventory management
After creating an account, the user will be able to search for electronics components using Octopart's API and add components to their inventory. From the inventory tab the user is able to manage their current inventory, whether updating quantity on hand or removing the components entirely. 

### Kit share
The user is able to create a kit by filling out a form and uploading a bill of materials (BOM) in .csv format. 

In the Kits tab the user can view all of the kits that have been created on the website. The kit page itself allows the user to view the BOM required for the kit and to instantly see if they have the required components required for the kit.
